        "title": "Why Explore Indian Philosophy?",
        "subtitle": "A journey into wisdom that transforms how we understand life itself",
        "intro1": "You are said to be indulging in philosophy whenever you set your mind to a systematic investigation of the nature of the world, selfhood, values, human good, the sources of knowledge, and the limits of human reason.",
        "intro2": "Philosophy attempts to explain what cannot be explained by science. However, it differentiates itself from faith and religion in its approach: constantly questioning rather than accepting a certain truth.",
        "paradoxTitle": "The Paradox of Indian Philosophy",
        "paradoxText": "Indian philosophy is often mixed with faith and religion because it is rooted in the authority of ancient, sacred texts. But the paradox—and the originality—of Indian philosophy is that although it respects these ancient texts, for centuries commentators have interpreted them with such creativity that the philosophy has progressed enormously with time.",
        "vedasText": "The very vastness of those ancient texts, called the Vedas, allowed authors to select any portion for their authority, leaving ample room for original thought. Contemporary Indian philosophers are well versed in both Western and Indian thought, contributing to this interpretive creativity. The Vedas provide such a rich list of philosophical ingredients that philosophers can constantly upgrade them to be suited to prevalent times. In fact, there are many schools of thought within Indian philosophy.",
        "questioningText": "Those commentators have also constantly encouraged questioning. They subjected their doctrines to rational analysis and justification, trying to give answers that rely as much as possible on logic. Strenuous attempts are made to show with logic and rationale what faith implicitly accepts.",
        "wayOfLife": "While in the West, philosophy is more of an intellectual exercise in search of the truth, in India, philosophy is more of a way of life. Although there is a strong truth-seeking strand in Indian philosophy, the truths sought are always ones that relate to the way we ought to live.",
        "conclusion": "Therein lies the answer to \"Why Indian philosophies?\" They offer a wealth of inspiring thoughts and wisdom to help us make sense of our existence and to live our life with more peace and happiness. And if, after a sincere attempt to explore, they do not serve you, one must not hesitate to give them up either.",

        "intro1": "Many are bewildered to encounter the pantheon of deities in India: blue-faced gods and goddesses riding on tigers or seated in lotus flowers, snakes coiled around their necks; a god that is half-elephant, half-man; another riding on a rat; an eight-armed goddess wearing human skulls as a necklace and severed heads at her waist.",
        "intro2": "As they go deeper, they recognize that belief in 'one God, eternal, omnific, omnipotent and omniscient' is fundamental to Indian philosophies, and that the multiplicity of deities is 'to be taken only in a figurative sense'. \"One in Many\" is the key theme, and that extends beyond deities to every living being.",
        "intro3": "While Indian philosophies are marked by immense internal diversity of belief and practices, we do find broad patterns. They acknowledge explicitly or implicitly the authority of a vast scriptural corpus in the Sanskrit language known collectively as the Vedas. Most also share the concept that the divine manifests in a diversity of ways and believe in the eternity of the soul—reborn in body after body, life after life, guided by karma.",

The Rig Veda is the earliest of the four Vedas, with the remaining three known as the Sama, Yajur, and Atharva Veda. The earliest hymns of the Rig Veda began to be transmitted orally. They addressed topics including the creation and structure of the universe, the natural world, and praise of a number of deities including Indra and Agni."

They were philosophical dialogues that appeared at the end of each of the four Vedas. Consequently, they are often referred to as Vedanta, which literally means \"the end of the Veda,\" a term that has also come to refer to several schools of Indian philosophy."

They were long narrative poems telling the stories of human heroes and dynasties with gods in supporting or guiding roles, centered on ethical dilemmas, dharma, and exemplary conduct in complex life situations. Their function was to show how dharma (or right code of conduct) is lived in the world: family conflict, kingship, warfare."

The Gita, one of the most widely read texts in the world, consists of a dialogue between the warrior Arjuna and his charioteer Krishna on the edge of a battlefield before the first day of war. The text blends a wide range of philosophical ideas within the context of a larger literary narrative.",
          "quote": "As Krishna describes it, life is an impermanent, dreamlike state in which the soul is beset by dreams and illusions. The wise man learns to recognise these illusions for what they are and, freed from desires and attachments, goes through life with complete serenity, at the end of it merging into eternal unity with Brahman, the omnipresent spirit of all created things."

These texts offer pragmatic teachings on how to behave in accordance with the dharmic order of the universe, containing prescriptions for social order, family life, and gender relations."

Their function was to bridge high philosophy with popular worship; they taught cosmology, bhakti, ritual observances, and the glory of specific deities and holy places."

          "content": "The vast array of deities in the Hindu pantheon is held together philosophically through the concept of \"Brahman,\" the infinite and eternal Ultimate spirit that underlies all existence. Brahman pervades all that exists, even the deities. The multiple divine forms are viewed as manifestations of that one Ultimate. Natural elements like the sun and rivers are viewed as divine forms worthy of worship. The worship of the divine in the feminine form is also an aspect that sets it apart."

          "content": "The shared assumption that validates the worship of the divine in multiple forms also validates diverse ways of worshipping. Depending on the inclination of an individual, various channels are recognized as valid: knowledge (gnan), meditation (dhyan), devotion (bhakti), and action (karma). Art is also recognized as a vital channel of religious expression. Music, dance, and painting are pursued as paths for approaching the divine."

          "content": "The guru system demands a different relationship from that of congregant and priest. The guru is seen as a path to—or in some cases an embodiment of—the divine. In philosophical systems that emphasize the disintegration of the ego, unconditional devotion to the guru is seen as the most efficient way for spiritual progress. However, this in no manner means to stop questioning or encourages blind faith. True gurus are those who encourage seekers to constantly question."

        "satsangDesc2": "Traditionally, a satsang is an audience with an enlightened teacher who provides spiritual instruction. However, in modern contexts, satsang can mean any gathering of people for the purpose of discussing, practicing, or contemplating spirituality.",

        "intro": "Many of the ideas of Indian philosophies, which were once regarded as eccentric, exotic, foreign, or cranky, are now part of everyday life. Where once Christian ministers and clerics railed against the \"heresies\" of Hinduism, yoga classes are now held in church halls. Meditation has been stripped of its spiritual connotations and rebranded as 'mindfulness'. Statues of the Buddha have become a ubiquitous accoutrement in design magazines. The term 'guru' has floated free of its original significance to become a cliché for any expert or wise counselor.",
        "deeperText": "However, this is akin to merely dipping your toes in the water. A vast ocean of peace and happiness awaits those who are prepared to delve deeper. Where societies rely on cold rationale and science, they often lose meaning and purpose, which is given by philosophy. After all, science is limited to what has been discovered physically, whereas spirituality extends to what has been discovered experientially.",
